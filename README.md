This is an illustration of the algorithmic approach to the study of social dynamics.

A society on a 3x3 grid randomly plays a Stag Hunt game between neighbors. Which of the two actions emerges as a social norm?

The notebook illustrates how the spanning tree approach from evolutionary game theory can be used to answer this question. The notebook computes the stochastically stable state.
